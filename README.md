An opinionated Chrome extension boilerplate with some fancy tooling:

* Supports ES6 via Babel and less
* Live rebuild and reload of the extension on file changes for development (`gulp watch`)
* Source map generation for development
* Distribution build tool (`gulp build`)
* Separate override manifest configuration file for distribution
